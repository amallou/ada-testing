# Welcome to the axe DevTools HTML API Examples Repo

Here you will find working examples of all of Deque's browser accessibility testing APIs.

This project is a work in progress. If what you're looking for isn't here, [contact us](mailto:helpdesk@deque.com) and we'll be happy to help.

These examples are broken down by coding language, then by testing framework and browser automation technology. 

An important note: these projects will not work as-installed. Axe DevTools HTML APIs require a license to access and use. For more information, check out [our website](https://deque.com).
