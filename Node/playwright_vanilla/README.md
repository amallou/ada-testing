Using axe DevTools Playwright webdriver binding, you can integrate axe DevTools into your existing testing environment instead of building your testing environment around axe DevTools.

# axe DevTools Playwright API Example

This example project demonstrates how axe DevTools Playwright webdriver binding detects the accessibility issues and generates reports in CSV, HTML, JSON, and XML formats.

## Prerequisites
- npm
- NodeJS (6.10 or higher)

## Clone Project

Follow these steps to clone and navigate to the directory:
1. Clone example project **`playwright_vanilla`** from GitHub.
2. Open the project folder in the code editor.
3. Open the terminal, and then navigate from the project root to the example.

```sh
cd Node/playwright_vanilla
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies **axe DevTools Playwright** and **axe DevTools Reporter** for the project.

> **_NOTE:_**
>You need a valid license to access and use our APIs and example projects. For more information, see [Install from Dequeâ€™s Agora](https://docs.deque.com/devtools-html/4.0.0/en/node-pl-install-agora) page. After configuring the access to Deque private registry, you can install the dependencies for this project.

The following command installs all the required dependencies **`@axe-devtools/playwright`** and **`@axe-devtools/reporter`** as mentioned in the **`package.json`** to run the example project.

```sh
npm install
```

## Test Configuration

You can configure multiple browsers as you would like in the **`playwright.config.js`**

```js
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
      },
    },

    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Firefox'],
      },
    },

    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Safari'],
      }
    }]
```

>To learn more about test configuration, see [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

## Run Tests

The **_tests_** directory contains the example test file **`example.spec.js`**. This test file shows two basic tests **`basic test_1`** and **`basic test_2`** that analyzes the page `https://broken-workshop.dequelabs.com/` for accessibility issues.

The following command runs the test files in the **_tests_** directory.

```sh
npm test
```

>To learn more about commands, see [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli).

## Test Results

The tests generate results in the **_a11y-results_** directory. Check each subdirectory for the respective format.

The **`/html/executive-report.html`** file is an executive summary report aggregating results from all scans into one page.


## Test Run Configuration

**`npm test`** runs the **`rimraf`** command mentioned in the **`package.json`**.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "rimraf ./a11y-results/ && npx playwright test --headed"
  },
```

Every time you run the **`npm test`**, the **`rimraf`** command clears all saved results from the **`a11y-results`** directory, so if you want to retain previous test results, you should remove **`rimraf`** from the **`scripts`** object. 

If you want to modify this project and publish your results in a different folder other than **`./ally-results`**, you should update the output directory in the test file and the **test** parameter.
